Authors: Benson Lam (The Hang Seng University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong) and Alan Liew (Griffith University, Australia)

Filename: demo.m 
Description: it shows examples of the proposed method in several different problems, namely an unconstrained problem, an equality constrained problem and an inequality constrained problem

Filename: Fast_BQP_Solver.m
Description: it is the main file for the proposed fast BQP solver

Filename: sub_solver.m
Description: it is a m-file that supports Fast_BQP_Solver.m

Filename: unconstrained_problem.mat, equality_constrained_problem.mat and inequality_constrained_problem.mat are the data files for the three problems. 
There are the experiments shown in Section 4.1 of the paper. The results are shown in Appendix IA(ii), IB(ii) and IC(ii) respectively.

Filename: 'square data.mat',''big rice data.mat','baby data (ineq partition).mat' are the data files for image restoration problems (Section 4.2(ii) and Section 4.3)
